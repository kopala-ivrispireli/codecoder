# codecoder
I create the code just for fun.
This program have to create code which contains
1. the first to characters of name of mother
2. the first two characters of name of father
3. mark of gender (1 is male, 2 is female)
4. last two characters of year of birth of person who needs this code

Example:
emto170
1. Name of mother Emili
2. Name of father Tom
3. Gender male (1)
4. Date of birth 1970

Next step.
Make the program take components of code from information I enter in some form, or file.
